# Level 00

We have a binary file asking for a password:
```sh
$ ./level00
***********************************
*            -Level00 -           *
***********************************
Password:42

Invalid Password!
```

By decompiling the code we find that the password is recovered by the program using scanf(%d) who transform the result into an integer. And juste below we find that this integer is 5276(0x149c) and then execute system("/bin/sh") if the password match.

```asm
   0x080484e7 <+83>:    cmp    $0x149c, %eax
```

So it's not an exploit here, but a simple code reading.

```sh
$ ./level00
***********************************
*            -Level00 -           *
***********************************
Password:5276

Authenticated!
$ whoami
level01
$ cat ../level01/.pass
```
